## 📦 Repository

A **repository** is simply a location where data is stored and managed.

In the context of Git, a **Git repository** is a project directory that is tracked and managed by Git. It contains all your project files along with the complete history of changes.

### 📍 Types of Repositories

- **Local Repository**:  
  Exists on your own computer. You can commit, branch, and manage history without needing a network.

- **Remote Repository**:  
  Hosted on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Enables collaboration by allowing multiple developers to push and pull changes.

✅ *Think of the local repo as your workspace, and the remote repo as the shared source of truth.*
