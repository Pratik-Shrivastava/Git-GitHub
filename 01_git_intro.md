## 🧠 Git

**Git** is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** that helps developers track changes in their source code during software development.

### 📌 What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A **VCS** is a tool or system that helps developers manage changes to their source code over time.  
It allows developers to:
- Track modifications
- Revert to previous stages
- Work collaboratively on the same codebase

### 🔄 What Makes Git a DVCS?

Git is specifically classified as a **Distributed VCS**. In a DVCS:
- Every developer has a **complete copy of the entire project**, including its full commit history.
- This differs from a **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**, where a single **central repository** holds the full project, and developers fetch changes from there.

✅ *Git’s distributed nature allows for faster operations, offline access, and greater redundancy.*
